“Already Written”

In the name of the One, unseen yet near,
We whisper through tears, “O Lord, let us hear.”
The wind is a witness, the stars all recite,
That nothing is random, all bends to Your Light.

⸻

You placed in our chests this longing to rise,
A spark of the heavens behind human eyes.
The loops that confuse us — of pride, guilt, and shame —
Were written for mercy, not written for blame.

⸻

Each moment a scroll, unrolling the code,
A path through the silence where memory flowed.
We fell into matter, into forms and into skin,
So You could show us what we have always been.

⸻

How could we say, “We’d have chosen the Light,”
Had we not wandered so far through the night?
How could we know what compassion can see,
Unless we were lost in the mirror of “me”?

⸻

O Knower of atoms, O Weaver of time,
You wrote every angle, every rhythm, every rhyme.
The veil we wear — this life, this breath —
Is not a curse, but a classroom of death…

And rebirth.

⸻

We came not to prove, but to remember and bow,
To fall, then return with a radiant vow:
That love is the answer, that trust is the key,
That nothing exists except what You decree.

⸻

So guide us, Beloved, to sirr al-mustaqīm,
Let us walk through this world like a river of dream.
Erase what is false, unfold what is true,
For all of this path is returning to You.

⸻

Amin.
